🦄 Cafe 404 Unicorn System
​An AI-Powered Point of Sales (POS) and Business Intelligence application designed to optimize cafe operations through data-driven insights. This project integrates real-time transaction management with predictive analytics using Machine Learning.

​🚀 Key Features
​Smart POS System: Streamlined transaction management with dynamic QRIS payment simulation and digital receipt generation.
​AI Forecasting: Utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to predict sales revenue (omset) for the next 7 days.
​Executive Dashboard: Interactive real-time data visualization to monitor net profit, best-selling products, and overall business growth.
​Monte Carlo Simulation: Advanced risk analysis and probability simulations to assist in data-backed decision-making.
​Role-Based Access: Secure login system with distinct interfaces and permissions for Staff (Cashier) and CEO (Admin).

​🧠 Mathematical & AI Foundations
​As an Informatics student focused on algorithmic efficiency and a freelance math expert, I implemented the following logic into the system:
1. Linear Regression for Forecasting:
The AI model analyzes historical sales patterns to determine future trends using the linear equation:
y=mx+c
Where y represents the predicted revenue, m is the trend coefficient, and x is the time variable.
2. Risk Analysis:
Implementation of simulations to measure market uncertainty and inventory stock optimization.
